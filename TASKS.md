# Task Management - ChatGPT Clone

## 🎯 Current Status
Your ChatGPT clone already has multiple chats working perfectly! Here's what's actually left to implement.

## 🚀 Remaining Tasks

### 1. Message Timestamps
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Add timestamps to all chat messages

**What to implement:**
- [ ] Display timestamp for each message (user and AI)
- [ ] Format timestamps in readable format (e.g., "2:30 PM", "Yesterday")
- [ ] Update message component to include timestamp
- [ ] Ensure timestamps are saved with message history

**Estimated Time**: 1 day

### 2. Image Saving to History
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Save and display images in chat history

**What to implement:**
- [ ] Store uploaded images in chat history (currently images are uploaded but not saved)
- [ ] Display saved images when switching between chats
- [ ] Handle image storage in localStorage or consider cloud storage
- [ ] Add image preview/thumbnail support in chat history

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

## 🧪 Testing (Simple Manual Testing)

### What to Test
- [ ] Verify timestamps display correctly on all messages
- [ ] Test image upload and verify they're saved in chat history
- [ ] Switch between chats and ensure images persist
- [ ] Test on mobile vs desktop to ensure responsiveness

### Edge Cases to Check
- [ ] What happens with very large images?
- [ ] Test with multiple images in one chat
- [ ] Verify chat switching during image upload

- **Message Features**: 50% complete (missing timestamps)
- **Image Features**: 30% complete (upload works, saving doesn't)

## 🔄 Development Plan

### Week 1
- **Day 1-2**: Implement message timestamps
- **Day 3-5**: Implement image saving to history

### Week 2
- **Day 1-3**: Testing and bug fixes
- **Day 4-5**: Polish and final touches

## 📝 Technical Notes

### For Timestamps
- Messages already have `createdAt` property from CopilotKit
- Just need to display this in the UI
- Consider using a library like `date-fns` for nice formatting

### For Image Saving
- Images are currently uploaded but not persisted
- Need to store image data in the same localStorage structure as messages
- Consider image compression for localStorage size limits
